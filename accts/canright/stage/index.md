Built (and use) a database grid front end to implement a content management system talking to a database through MS IIS, ASP, SQL.

Expert in core web technologies foundational to all frameworks.  Ready to build with any javascript client-side framework.  Have worked with angular 1 and am working with react.

### Client-side Javascript Tools or Frameworks:

**anglular 1**: I am familiar (but not fresh).  My deepest dive was to prototype a collaborative document manager.

**react**: I am re-factoring my library of client side javascript tools (slide-show, scroll, navigation grid, ...) to use react.

I am familiar with most, but expert with none of the frameworks.  I am comfortable focusing on any of them.

My experience is with the core tools - arguably the best foundation for any of the frameworks.
