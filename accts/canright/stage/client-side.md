### Client-side Frameworks

angular: Developed a prototype of a collaborative document manager with angular 1 early last year.

react: Re-factoring client side javascript components (slide-show, scroll, navigation grid, ...) with react.

Expert with vanillaJS (HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, javascript, DOM, MVC).  Familiar with some, but expert with none of the popular frameworks.  Experience is with the core tools - the best foundation for any framework.
