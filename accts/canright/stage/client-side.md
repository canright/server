### Expert with core client side tools:
- HTML5, CSS
- jQuery, Javascript, DOM
- Ajax, CSS3, less
- All of my portfolio sites (below) are built with those core tools.

Built (and use) a new administration framework to maintain data on a MS Sql Server database.  This application uses the core tools and Slick Grid on the client side.  (This is an MS IIS, ASP, Sql Server project on the server side.

### Client-side Javascript Tools or Frameworks:

anglular 1: I am familiar (but not fresh).  My deepest dive was to prototype a collaborative document manager.

react: I am re-factoring my library of client side javascript tools (slide-show, scroll, navigation grid, ...) to use react.

I am fmailiar with most, but expert with none of the frameworks.  I am comfortable focusing on any of them.

My experience is with the core tools - arguably the best foundation for any of the frameworks.
