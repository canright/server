      "blurb": "Edward Wikoff, AIA is a graduate of the Miami University, School of Architecture in Oxford, Ohio. Having received a Masters of Architecture Degree in 1982 Mr. Wikoff returned to the east coast spending the first ten years of his professional career working for the nationally acclaimed firms of Arthur Cotton Moore, Architects, Harry Weese and Associates, and Perkins & Will. After receiving his professional license he began practicing as a sole proprietor designing renovations and additions to townhouses on Capital Hill and in Georgetown neighborhoods. A move to New Orleans in the early 90's allowed him to continue his residential practice renovating and enlarging historic homes in both the French Quarter and Uptown.\n\nWith a growing family Edward and Nora again relocated to the Mississippi Gulf Coast purchasing an old home a short walk from the beach and renovating it to accommodate there family of five children. This home and others continued their interest in residential design that recently culminated in the completion of a new home for the Brothers of the Sacred Heart in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi.\n\nCommercial and institutional design has played an increasingly important role in the development of the firm. Projects completed in collaboration with Compton Engineering for both Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman provided experience on large scale corporate projects. More institutional structures such as the new dining hall and dormitory expansion for St. Stanislaus College and a new building for the Pass Christian Historical Society permitted explorations in both contextual insertions and historic reconstruction.\n\nEdward has experience with a diverse client base and building types that has fostered a respect or differing design styles. Personal preferences for both period and contemporary design can be seen in the balance of eclectic and contemporary objects and materials evident in their own home. This architect allows the project type, context and client determine the appropriate style with the Client and community benefitting in the end."
