  "info": "Completed: 2009 &bull; Size: 3,000 sf &bull; Budget: Withheld by Owner\n\nPeter and Laura Lucore lost their home to Hurricane Katrina in August of 2005. This new home, built on the site of the original, will provide space for a growing family of six. The appearance is very much that of an arts and crafts bungalow raised above the new base flood elevation and updated to provide much needed storage and living space for the families three boys.\n\nThe plan provides for family living spaces and kitchen on the main level along with a master bedroom suite and daughter Elena's bedroom. The top floor provides three bedrooms for the boys, bathroom, study and game spaces. The house is raised above lowest level parking and storage space with plans for a future pool. The exterior proportions and trim are consistent with the bungalow style and uses James Hardie products for trim and siding."
