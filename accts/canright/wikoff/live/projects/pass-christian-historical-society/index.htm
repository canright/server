  "info": "Projected Completion: 2010 &bull; Size: approx. 6,000 sf &bull; Budget: $1.0 - 1.5 million\n\nThis building is being constructed to replace the original 1915 building that had served as the headquarters for the Historical Society for a number of years. That building was destroyed in Hurricane Katrina therefore the new facility will be able to withstand 140 mph winds and provides a second floor with safe storage space above the high water line. The project is FEMA funded and will provide meeting space for the membership as well as a library for reading and research of the many documents that the Society was able to save after the storm or assemble thru donations from the residents of this historic gulf side community.\n\nThe building is sited on a bluff above the beach looking south across Scenic Drive. A front porch will invite residents to rest on the steps and take in the view or a passing Mardi Gras parade."
