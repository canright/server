  "info": "Completed: Fall 2008 &bull; Size: 6,500 sf &bull; Budget: $1,200,000.00\n\nThis new home was designed and constructed to house the Brothers of the Sacred Heart who operate St. Stanislaus College Boys Preparatory School located in \"The Bay\" for over 150 years. The original home was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. Many century old vacation and permanent residences were lost to that storm and the design of this home pays homage to the style, material and proportion of these structures. While designed to withstand 140 mph winds the house maintains the deep overhangs, porches, beach views and cross ventilation so typical of those age old homes. The standing seam metal roof proved its value on many structures that held up to the intensity of the storm and its use here makes a strong pragmatic and aesthetic statement.\n\nThe plan provides large public spaces for living, dining and chapel while in the rear and second floor of the home individual bedroom suites with bath accommodate eight Brothers. A courtyard created by the buildings plan provides a quite outdoor room that faces the campus."
