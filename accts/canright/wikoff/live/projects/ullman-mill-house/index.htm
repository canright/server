  "info": "Completed: 2006 &bull; Size: approx. 3,000 sf &bull; Budget: $150,000.00\n\nThis home was substantially damaged by Hurricane Katrina. The original structure was constructed in 1860 as a woolen mill that closed its doors during the 1920's. Shortly after closing the mill was divided into four parts, of which two survive today, and converted to single family homes. The Owners have undertaken several renovations to accommodate a growing family with the most recent being the storm repairs.  The first floor provides living spaces including a living room, family room, dining and kitchen spaces as well as an office, master bedroom suite and an additional bedroom with bath.\n\nThe most recent alteration expanded the kitchen to double its original size and provides a considerable deck overlooking the back yard. The home is an eclectic combination of new and old with the high ceilings and porch typical of a coastal cottage and new aluminum storefront windows to the rear allowing for views to the yard and children at play."
