  "info": "Completed Fall of 2013\n\nThis project consists of three structures which  provides a home for the Owner Facing the beach, a 10 unit Guest House at the rear of the property and a two story Cabana overlooking the pool and providing a restroom and ADA accessible living quarters on the ground floor with additional meeting space on the second floor. The simple clapboard siding, standing seam metal roof and deep overhangs inherent in this Acadian coastal cottage style sits well within the Bay St. Louis Historic District and allows for generous porches and views of the Bay."
