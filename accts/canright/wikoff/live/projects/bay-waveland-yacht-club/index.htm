  "info": "The new club facility was planned thru the Design/Build process controlling costs and schedule incorporating the design services of Jahncke-Burns Architects, New Orleans, Spartan Construction, Mandeville, Louisiana and Edward H. Wikoff, AIA as the Architect of Record. With the clubs original facility destroyed by Katrina this new structure provides expanded kitchen, restaurant, bar and entertaining facilities along with offices and meeting rooms. The view provided from the veranda takes in the Bay of St. Louis and the Mississippi Sound. Improvements to the boat slips, harbor, parking and boat storage areas provide a popular location for both resident and out of town members and guests to gather.\n\nThe structure is composed of a reinforced concrete foundation, piers and main floor slab raising the facility above the new base flood elevation. The steel structure is designed to withstand hurricane force winds while the exterior fa&ccedil;ade presents a traditional clapboard look with James Hardie Company lap siding, windows protected with operable shutters and galvanized metal roofing. The widows walk and cupola provide an attractive look out and beacon making this building a recognizable landmark along the Mississippi Coast."
