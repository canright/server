  "info": "Originally Completed: 1994, Completed Repaired/Renovated: 2007 &bull; Size: 4,300 sf &bull; Budget: $450,000.00\n\nThis 4,300 square foot residence was designed and constructed in the mid 1990's to accommodate a young physician and his growing family. The home is sited to take advantage of magnificent views toward the Gulf of Mexico with primary first floor living spaces facing the water. The living room, study and kitchen face south and look across a wide porch providing ample entertainment space while a concealed bar beneath the stair serves all guests.  A guest bedroom and bath are located off of the study on the first floor while four additional bedrooms, including the master suite, are provided on the second floor. Hurricane Katrina washed out the ground floor spaces but left the structure intact and the second floor spaces untouched. This home was one of the very few beachfront structures in Pascagoula to remain after the storm and the Client was able to quickly make repairs and return."
