  "info": "Projected Completion: 2010 &bull; Size: approx. 50,000 sf &bull; Budget: $5.5 -6.0 million\n\nThe existing Aurelian Hall was constructed in the late 1960's to house boarding students at this college preparatory school operated by the Brothers of the Sacred Heart. The current building is short on activity space for the boys therefore the expansion will provide recreational space as well as study halls and lounge areas. The new vaulted facility will join the two wings of the current structure creating an interior atrium that half of the rooms will look over. Study halls at each of the upper levels will provide quiet areas for study. Game and music rooms at the first floor will provide recreational space lacking on campus since Katrina damaged other facilities in 2005.\n\nAn elevator, loading dock and updated mechanical system will make the operation of this much used facility much easier for students, campers and visitors all year long."
