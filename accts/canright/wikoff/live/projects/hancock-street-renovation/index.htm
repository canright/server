  "info": "Completed Fall 2015\n\nThis property was purchased as home base for a recently retired professional couple. The 3,000 square foot renovation of an existing structure within the Bay St. Louis Historic District provides ample living and entertaining spaces with a spacious front porch, elegant front parlors and a professionally outfitted kitchen. Double master bedroom suites at the rear of the ground floor provide a quiet oasis away from the entertaining areas and guest accommodations at the second floor, in the former attic, allow guest their own private destination. The landscaping of the front and rear yards add to the options for entertaining with outdoor dining and a fire pit complimented by the new fountain along with a sauna and outdoor showers built into the adjacent carport."
