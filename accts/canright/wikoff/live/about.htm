  "blurb": "Edward H. Wikoff, AIA, PC was formed after Hurricane Katrina by Edward Wikoff and Nora Mestayer Wikoff to assist with the reconstruction of their surrounding communities of Waveland, Bay St. Louis and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The firm offers architectural and interior design services for projects of varying sizes from coastal vacation cottages and custom homes to education facilities, office and commercial properties. The office currently provides architectural, interior design and construction management expertise. AutoCAD 2015, Sketchup, Building Information Modeling (BIM) as well as Architectural 3D modeling and graphics are all tools utilized in the creation of each project. Services are often provided from initial schematic and programming phases thru construction management with many return clients.\n\nStylistically we take pride in our ability to fulfill a Clients desire rather than impose a preferred \"look\". We believe that all periods of our architectural heritage have value and, when done properly, have an intrinsic value. Certainly good design representing any period is better than poorly constructed versions of the latest trend."
