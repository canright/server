## Employment History

**Canright | Owner / Principal**: Portland OR, 1995 - Present

A successful consulting firm.  Architected, designed, developed and supported custom web database applications for entrepreneurial 'dot-coms' and established 'brick and mortars'.  During the dot com boom, Canright was listed as a Portland Business Journal Top 100 fastest growing company three times with up to two dozen employees.  During that period, our work was best charactarized as **web database applications for business** primarily on the Microsoft Stack (*.Net, IIS, Sql Server, C#, ASP, vbScript, jScript*) and client side web technologies (*HTML, CSS and javascript*).

After the dot com crash, with a smaller team of half a dozen software engineers, a few designers and a few people in sales, administration and support, Canright developed the **Extranet Kit** and then leveraged it to launch the successful **Websites for Architects** venture.

Technology advanced (HTML5, jQuery, improved javascript, CSS3, node, noSql DBs).  Canright embraced these technologies as they developed and migrated tools and techniques toward them.  Canright now hosts Linux Ubuntu 16.04 Servers running Node 6.7.0 and Redis, MongoDb and MariaDb.
